# Apple Disease Identification Using Computer Vision

The Apple Disease Identification Project is a digital tool designed to assist farmers, orchard managers, and agricultural specialists in identifying diseases affecting apple trees. Leveraging technologies such as image recognition and machine learning, the project aims to streamline the process of diagnosing apple tree diseases. Users can upload images of affected leaves, fruits, or the entire tree, and the system provides real-time analysis, suggesting potential diseases and treatment options. By enabling rapid and accurate identification, the project helps farmers make informed decisions to protect their orchards and optimize crop yields.

## Deployment

To deploy this machine learning model on mobile application we convert the .h5 model to .tflite model

```bash
  import tensorflow as tf
   model = tf.keras.models.load_model('your_model.h5')
```
```bash
  converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
  tflite_model = converter.convert()
```
```bash
  with open('converted_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
```

After that we deploye the tflite model on flutter mobile application by using
```bash
  String res = await Tflite.loadModel(
  model: "assets/appe_disease_model.tflite",
  labels: "assets/labels.txt",
  numThreads: 1, 
  isAsset: true, 
  useGpuDelegate: false 
);
```
